# CTEC 126 - Lab No. 12

## Overview

Using JavaScript and jQuery, modify the code in this repository to display ALL of the data from this API:

[IdeaJam What's Hot API Endpoint](http://ideajam.net/ideajam/p/ij.nsf/jsonGetWhatsHot)

You are also to style the page using CSS. I expect to see **a professional looking page**.

Place comments in the code where/when asked to do so.

- The page should include and use a style sheet.
- The CSS should be in a separate folder.
