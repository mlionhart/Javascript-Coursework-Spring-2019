    <h1>Practice Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Mike Hart.  I like to read non-fiction and textbooks, I like composing music, I like math and numbers, 
        so far I like programming, I am 32, this is my 2nd term back at Clark after a 10-year hiatus.  
        Before that I completed about 2 years of coursework, including receiving a certificate of 
        proficiency in Power Utilities.  I am excited about embarking on this new life course involving
        web development.  So far, a large amount of what I've been learning has been fascinating to me, and I
        can already tell that it's only going to get more complex - which I prefer.  This was ultimately 
        what led me to become bored with the Power Utilities program - there was no intellectual challenge.</p>

    <h2>What I Hope to Accomplish with this Class</h2>   
    <p>I would like to become proficient in Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, and JSON, and I would also like to become a more confident and competent
        programmer and web developer.  I suspect this class will also help me exercise my critical thinking skills in ways that will 
        enhance my competence in these areas.  A new intellectual challenge such as this class is always a good thing.
    </p>
 
    <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
    <p>I am completely new to programming languages, besides the basics I studied over spring break, so I don't have any 
        programming languages I can list.  However, for the purposes of completing the assignment fully, I will list the 
        languages I am currently studying.  I am assuming that I am not to include markup, such as HTML and CSS.
