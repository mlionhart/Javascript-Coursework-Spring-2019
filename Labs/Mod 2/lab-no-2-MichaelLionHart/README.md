# CTEC 126 - Lab No. 2

## Details

This lab contains **two problems**. You are to use embedded JavaScript for each of the problems. If you want to externalize JavaScript for each problem, you can.

## Problem No. 1 (50 points)

Using the starter code that I have provided in lab2-problem1.html, write JavaScript that prompts a user to input a number within the range of 1 through 10. The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number. If the number is outside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display an error message. Use if..else logic for this problem. The code should execute when the **START** button on the page is clicked which I have provided for you. The output should display on the page. I have also provided this code for you to use.

The following table shows the Roman numerals for the numbers 1 through 10:

| Number | Roman Numeral |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | I |
| 2  | II |
| 3 | III |
| 4 | IV |
| 5 | V |
| 6 | VI |
| 7 | VII |
| 8 | VIII |
| 9 | IX |
| 10 | X |

## Problem 1 Grading Rubric

| Item | Full Marks | Partial Marks | No Marks |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Check to make sure input is between 1 and 10 (inclusive) | 25 | 13 | 0 |
| If logic works correctly | 25 | 13 | 0 |

## Problem No. 2 (50 points)

Repeat Problem 1, but use a switch statement rather than if..else logic. Use **lab2-problem2.html** for your work.
