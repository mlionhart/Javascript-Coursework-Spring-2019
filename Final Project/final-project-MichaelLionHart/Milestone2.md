Milestone 2
Date: 6/5/19
Progress: Personality test

1. I created and unsubmittable form, because It is a test and won't be submitted.  I have added jquery and logic to calculate
someone's personality type, based on which radio buttons they select when answering the form questions. 

2. The logic I used was mostly if/else if/else, and a series of if/else statements, that calculate the order and number of 
the radio button values, and add them up.

3. After everything has been calculated, I have the result printed in the 'result' div at the bottom of the page - revealing the 
person's personality type.  

4. The last part, that I haven't figured out yet, is displaying a short description of what each personality characteristic/trait is.
I have started an array of arrays to store the content, but haven't figured out yet how to get it to work, and append the content to the div.
I have commented out everything that is unfinished, and left what works.
