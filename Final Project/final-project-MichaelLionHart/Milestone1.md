Milestone #1:  Final Project Specifications

Website #1:
-	I will create a personality test in HTML and use Javascript and jQuery and logic to process the results of the test answers, perform some calculations, and present the user with their personality type.  
Website #2:
-	The second site will be an interactive tip calculator that the user can input the amount of the check and the tip percentage of choice, and the correct amount will be returned to them.
Website #3:
-	I will create a form with validation and error buckets, that prevents submission if there is a missing input, and notifies the user what needs to be filled out.
