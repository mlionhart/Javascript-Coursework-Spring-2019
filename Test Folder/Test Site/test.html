        Unlike most other guitar teaching services, we at All-Hart don't get caught
        up in the boring routine details of learning guitar, like proper finger
        placement and grip (bleh).  Some of the best guitarists in the world have 
        an unorthodox playing style or improper form - like Mark Knopfler. Instead,
        we guide and help mold your natural "flow," your natural playing style.  
        Most people are not looking to become concert-level guitarists, or virtuoso's.

        The problem with most guitar teachers is just that - they train you as if you
        are training to be a concert Guitarist.  But here's the thing: most people 
        just want to be able to jam with their friends, play their favorite songs,
        or impress people with their mad skills.  We help you do just that!  Our method
        is to quickly take you to a level that turns heads and makes people say, "wow,
        he/she is good!"  You'd be amazed how quickly and easily we can get you there.
        It's our specialty!  No headaches, no boring drills, just playing and having fun!
        So get ready to have some fun!
