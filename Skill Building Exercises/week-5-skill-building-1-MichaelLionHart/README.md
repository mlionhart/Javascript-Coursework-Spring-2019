# CTEC 126 - Week 5 - Skill Building No. 1

You have been asked by the marketing department to further develop this web page. They have asked for the following:

1. Develop JavaScript that will allow the picture and alt attribute to be switched out when a user hovers over a persons name.
2. Make sure that all of the images are displayed as the same size. They ask that you resize them using an image editor. The images of the people can be found in the **img** folder.
3. Once you complete steps 1 and 2, please notify the instructor so they can review your work.
4. The marketing department would also like fo you to add a visual effect that transitions the image using a fade in effect. This should be done with JavaScript and CSS.
