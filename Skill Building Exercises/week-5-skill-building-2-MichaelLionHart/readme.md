# CTEC 126 - Week 5 - Skill Building No. 2

You have been asked by the marketing department to further develop this web page. They have asked for the following:

1. They want the list of names removed and replaced with JavaScript code that will cycle through each of the 5 images one at a time and in order.
2. Each image should display for 5 seconds.
3. You do need to provide buttons that will stop and start the animation cycle.
4. The start button shouldn't be shown when the page loads. Only the stop button should be displayed.
5. If the user clicks on the stop button, the start button should appear.
6. They asked that you not only display the images but also the name of each person below the image. The alt attribute of the picture should also be changed to the persons name.
7. Use an array of arrays to store the image path and the name of the person.
8. Call the instructor over when you have completed your coding.
9. Once the instructor has verified your code, add code that will fade the image out before the next one is to be displayed.
